# solid-urql | @urql/solid

This is a temporary proxy hosting of the official work in progress `@urql/solid` package, which you can find at [FormidableLabs/urql](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/tree/solid-urql/packages/solid-urql) in the `solid-urql` branch.

I liked the work done over there, but because of their monorepo model, I can not simply depend on this package as a git dependency since npm does not support specifying a path for such dependencies. Therefor I took initiative in reuploading the package at the root of a repository.

Do note that the package in this repository, as supposed to the one over at `FormidableLabs`, has some changes done to it's type exports. Otherwise the code should be pretty much identical.

Do also note that I won't really be keeping this package up to date.
